If either of these functions is called in a command that was invoked using the mouse—more precisely, 

if last-nonmenu-event (see Command Loop Info) is either nil or a list—then it uses a dialog box or pop-up menu to ask the question. 

Otherwise, it uses keyboard input. You can force use either of the mouse or of keyboard input by binding last-nonmenu-event to a suitable value around the call.

It is worth noting that using progn works in both cases, while omitting it only works if the macro accepts multiple forms. 

As a result of this, some people prefer to simply always use progn,because it will always work.
