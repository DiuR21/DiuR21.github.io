* The Question
#+begin_quote
我终于发现，对于悲剧以及痛苦。我沉迷其中，而不可自拔。而这似乎是人的通病。
观察获奖的经典电影，其核心无外乎是悲剧。似乎于部分人而言，悲剧就如火对比之飞蛾。其原因到底是追求所谓的深刻，抑或不过是对廉价的喜剧的睥睨？ --dctrl

  postive question and negative question..

  don't let the negative question to blind your eyes.

  question very often create reality.

* The Role Model  
#+begin_quote
为何总是对成功执着，而对平凡嗤之以鼻？可能就是内心深处坚定不移地认为人生是没有意义的。若不能成为卓越，那又有什么理由苟活呢？
不能精彩的活着，还不如精彩的死去？？

  Learn from your Role Model. How they react when surffering the hard time.
  | Passive victim | Active Agent      |
  | self pity      | take action       |
  | blame          | responsibility    |
  | frustration    | confidence        |
  | anger          | hope and optimism |
  | no result      | make thing easier |

* Happiness isn't the Negation of Unhappiness
  | Disease Model                | Health Model              |
  | Focus on Weakness            | Focus on strengths        |
  | Overcoming deficiencies      | Builfinh competencies     |
  | Avoiding pain                | Seeking pleasure          |
  | Running from unhappiness     | Pursuing happiness        |
  | Neutral state (0) as ceiling | No ceiling                |
  | Tensionless as ideal         | Creative tension as ideal |

  Let's go beyond that.*Because the ideal is not just a tensionless state*. It is the creative tension.

  Don't be comfortably numb.

  The problem of me. Is that I always focus on something which called realistic. However, life is fulfilled with opportunities. For sure that I'm not the God that means I cannot predict what will happen in the future.

  May be I just need to reliaze that negative fact maybe cannot lead me to be a happier person. It might just only destory me.

  And the fact that Happiness isn't that Negation of Unhappiness is totally refreashing.

  Conventional model think that take away the illness than people become healthy.

  But positive psychological model is slightly different.It is you're ill because you don't have enough health in your life and don't pursuing those things that make you healthy.
  
  Happiness does not just come spontaneously when we negate unhappiness.

* Happiness as Stochastic Phenomenon
  #+begin_quote
  It may be that trying to be happier is as futile as trying to be taller, 
  and is therefore counter-productive.
  #+end_quote
  
  There is counter-evidence, where people actually do change.

  Think about an 8-year-old girl who's very unhappy and then reads some magazine about that study saying that "basically, your genetic set point what you're born with -- is there for life."

* Thomas Sowell
  why people choose to back one political party versus the other, why they choose to live one kind of life versus the other.

  Essentially what he does is divide people into two camps: Those who hold constrained vision, the limited vision, and those who hold the unconstrained, the unlimited vision of human nature.

  Peoplpe who hold constrained vision of human naturue believe that human nature cannot be changed. It's immutable. We have certain instincts. We have certain inclinations. 
  
  Now we have the unconstrained vision. Perhaps you are a little bit more optimistic, a little bit more utopian. Human nature can be improved. It can be changed.
  
  It is up to us to do so. It's perfectable. We don't need to accept these flaws as inevitable. Generally people on constrained view, are people politicaly, not always, but usually people who would support capitalism.
 
  Let's channel imperfect, perhaps flawed human nature toward the good. People who are more on the unconstrained vision would tend to toward Utopainism or sometimes Communism.

* The Permission to Be Huamn
  The course believe that huamn nature is fixed. So might be the constrained vision is better.

  There are two kinds of people, who experience this constant high, who don't experience painful emotions, such as anger, or envy, or disappointment, or sadness, or unhappiness, or depression, or anxiety at times.

  The one kind are the psychopaths. The second kind of people who don't experience thesee painful emotions are dead people. 

  *However, in our culture today, we don't give ourselves the permission to be human, the freedom to experience these painful emotions as well.*

  We begin to realize that other people are watching us and evaluating us constantly. That's when we stop give us the permission to be human and we pay a price, in terms of our energy levels, of our well-being, of your happiness, of our creativity, and ultimatyle also, our success.

  Now, normally I would think "What a hypocrite!" It's just, something is wrong. You know, one minute you are envious, the next moment you experience love. Well, there is nothing wrong. There is everything right.
  
  Painful emotions are as much part of human nature, as the law of gravity is part of physical nature. And the nature to be commanded must be obeyed.

  It's not resignation but is active acceptance. 
  
  

  
  

  
  
  

  

    
* Selfish is ok
  Don't feel guilty when activing selfish.

  Showing how people who help, whether it's helping five extra acts during the week, it can be more, doesn't have to be restricted to five -- 
  
  or people whoh help five extra acts during one day, it actually contributes to their well-being. So helping others is also helping ourselves. 
  
  One of the things that I say and only half in jest is that I know of no more selfish act than a benevolent act. 

  Where halping others helps ourselves, and helping ourselves in ture helps others. And rather than looking it as selfish, and some people may feel this easy way that 

  rather though is looking as selfish i.e. equal immoral, we should look it as something that is so wonderful about our nature. A part of our nature that we should celebrate.

  The fact that our happiness is tied to others, the fact that we are tied to others in the web of empathy. 

  
* Belief
  Beliefs are self-fulfilling prophecies. Very often they determine how we perform, how well or how poorly we perform. 

  They often determine how good or not so good our relationships are. They're the number one predictor of life success as well as well-being.

  but who were labeled "fast spurters", their IQ increased significantly over the year and maintanined that increase in a longitudinal study. IQ's suppose to be your intelligent quotient that you are born with.

  It's immutable, doesn't change from the day you were born to the day you die, or so they thought. It changes significantly just based on the belief that the teacher had in her or his students, belief as self-fulfilling prophecies. What happened in the study?

  Was it that the teachers were fooled? And suddenly were made to see an illusion? No. It was that they were illuded before, and it was the illusion that they didn't see what is right in front of their very eyes, Which is the potential inherent in every single student.

  And then Robert Rosenthal comes and fools them in a sense, but "fools" them into seeing what has been there all along.

  The Power of Situation: "Asch Conformity Experiments" -- "The Obedience to Authority" -- Philip Zimbardo's prison experiment.
  
  Good Situation: What she did was to take men who were about  75 years old, and sent them to a retreat, which was a 1959 retreat, meaning even though it was 1979, the music was from 1959. The magazines that they read were all around 1959. The daily newspapers werw 1959. Everything was 1959. Even they had to go into a role, just like Zimbrado.

  *One week, retreat. At the end of the week, both mental and biological age decreased.*
